## Abstract:
In developing countries like Bangladesh, there are places from where students tend to move to other places from their localities to acquire their higher secondary certificate education (HSC) when they finish their secondary school certificate education (SSC). The places where these movements are occurring frequently and factors that are related to it is unknown. It is important to sort out the factors because it can work as suggesting factors to start the overall educational development scheme. In this study, raw data from Sylhet Education Board containing information of 3,08,875 students from Sylhet division to produce a refined dataset containing many properties of students. Descriptive statistics were applied to define a threshold distance. The students were split into two groups on the basis of whether students travelled beyond or below the threshold distance. Comparing the HSC grades between both the groups and the migration frequency and with the help of student t test and effective data visualization, locations were categorized to sort out the locations where migration is more frequent and the migration is yielding good grade points.
