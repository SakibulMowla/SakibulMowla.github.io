Just came to understand lately that all lands are eventually islands. It is only the enclaves who are treated differently. My life will never be the same again. Natural minority I should say.

Rabindranath Tagore died in 1941. India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh got independence respectively in 1947, 1948 and 1971. India's and Bangladesh's national anthems are written by Rabindranath Tagore while Sri Lanka's national anthem is inspired by his work. So basically he's written national anthems for the nations that were yet to be born without even knowing their names. What a visionary and what an absolute spoiler. I wonder if he put any "Spoiler Alert" tag before his compositions. Otherwise the British Empire mustn't be very happy about it considering the amount of anger people convey these days when they get spoiler for just a movie or a TV show.

So the new YouTube Music app is on the market and the monthly subscription fee for the premium version costs more than the monthly subscription fee of Netflix or Amazon Prime. Is the music just gonna play on the mobile or the singers gonna come home for some live action as well? What am I missing here? YouTube Music and chill is on it's way maybe!
